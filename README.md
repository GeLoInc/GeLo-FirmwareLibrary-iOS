# GeLo-FirmwareLibrary

The static library and headers to use to interact with a Gelo beacon in configuration mode.

If you are here you may want to download the Gelo over-the-air configuration app which can be found at [https://github.com/GeLoInc/GeLo-OTAC-iOS](https://github.com/GeLoInc/GeLo-OTAC-iOS).

If you really want to write your own OTAC app then this is the library to use.
